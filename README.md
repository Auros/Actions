## Macro Dashboard
- Create a page of macros which you can use in game
- In Game Macro Builder
- Player-binded macros to work target users in the user dashboard.
- Supports Commands (/ban, /timeout, /slowmode and Normal Messages

## User Dashboard
- Top 10 most recent chatters will always appear here
- Click on them to timeout or ban them

## Player-binding
- By putting {user} in the content field of a macro, this tells Actions to substitute that for an image. If you then activate that macro, you will have 10 seconds to click on a user in the User Dashboard and will be able to execute that macro with the user's name substituted.
